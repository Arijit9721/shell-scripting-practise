<h1> Shell Scripting Practice </h1>
This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing Shell (Bash) scripting through practical examples. It is structured into six folders, each representing a day of progressive learning, starting from the basics and advancing to more complex tasks.

## 📂 Repository Structure

-   **`day1`**: Introduction to Bash scripting.
-   **`day2`**: Basics of Bash scripting.
-   **`day3`**: Error handling and a Django application deployment.
-   **`day4`**: Creating a VM with GCP and gcloud CLI.
-   **`day5`**: Introduction to Makefiles and Docker commands.
-   **`day6`**: File backup automation with rotation management.

## 🗓️ Daily Topics

### 📅 Day 1: Basics of Bash Scripting

-   Learned about the **shebang (`#!`)**, a special character sequence at the beginning of a script.
-   Used the **`echo`** command to display text on the terminal.
-   Created a simple script to print "Hello, World!".

### 📅 Day 2: Core Concepts of Bash

    -   **Variables**: Declaring and using variables.
    -   **Control Structures**: `if-else` conditions.
    -   **Arguments**: Handling script input arguments.
    -   **Functions**: Writing reusable code blocks.
    -   **Loops**: Using `for` and `while` loops for iteration.

### 📅 Day 3: Error Handling & Django Deployment

-   Learned to manage and handle errors in Bash scripts.
-   Created and deployed a **Django application** using a shell script.

### 📅 Day 4: Automating GCP Tasks

-   Created a script to:
    1.  Download and install the **gcloud CLI**.
    2.  Create a **service account** for authentication.
    3.  Spin up a **Google Cloud VM instance** with minimal manual interaction.

### 📅 Day 5: Makefiles and Docker

-   Learned about the **Make utility**.
-   Created a basic **Makefile** for simplifying Docker commands:
    -   Commands for building, running, and stopping Docker containers.

### 📅 Day 6: File Backup Automation

-   Created a script for **zipped file backups**:
